		<h3> There are lots of parks, and chains of parks throughout the United States and the world. Each chain
		has their own characteristics that distinguish their parks from the others. They all value different
		aspects of their parks. Some value theming more than others, some want the tallest and fastest
		new rides, and some are somewhere in between. Some parks are also owned independently. This means that
		They are not owned by any major company.

		<h1>Six Flags</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/sf.jpg">
			<p> Six Flags is a very large amusement park chain that has various locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
			They are known for making large parks with lots of high trill atractions. However they are also known for
			their lack of theming on their rides, and their parks not looking as good as some others. They tend to not have
			very many trees or plants, so their parks are mostly just concrete, and don't have too much charm to them.
			They are also known for being cheap on their investments. They tend to take the cheaper route when getting
			new rides and attractions, and they don't like to spend large amounts of money. However overall they are still
			good parks because of their great coaster collections, they are just lacking in some other areas. But if you
			are a coaster enthusiast, then the roller coasters are what you care about most anyways. </p>

		<h1>Universal</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/uv.jpg">
			<p>Universal is a large theme park chain that is known for their heavy focus on theming and park atmosphere. They
			have parks in Florida, California, Singapore, Japan, And China. They usually have lots of flat rides and dark rides,
			with a few roller coasters. They are not afraid to spend lots of money on large investments, in order to insure that
			Their rides are well themed, immersive, and fun. They don't have as many coaster's as some other chains. But they make
			up for that in other areas, and the coasters that they do have are incredible.</p>

		<h1>Seaworld</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/sw.jpg">
			<p>Seaworld is a mid-sized chain that has parks exclusively in the United States. Their parks usually have a good balance between 
			coasters, theming, and atmosphere. They have some great coasters, and their parks also look good. Combining all these things together
			makes for a solid theme park chain. One negative about Seaworld though is the cruel treatment of their animals. While many other parks
			have animals, Seaworld's treatment of them has been particularly bad.

		<h1>Cedar Fair</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/cf.jpg">
			<p> 
			Cedar Fair is a very large amusement park chain that is known for their world class coaster collection. They have many locations all across the
			United States, and one in Canada. They mainly focus on their coaster lineups more than anything else. But they do have better theming and park
			atmosphere than Six Flags does, which is one of their top competitors. Just think of Cedar Fair as a more well rounded Six Flags. They are overall
			a great chain, and it's no wonder why they are consistently praised amongst coaster enthusiasts as one of the best.

		<h1>Disney</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/disney.jpg">
			<p>
			Disney is a large chain that has parks across the United States, China, France, Japan, and Hong Kong. They are very well known across the world,
			and most people have heard of their parks. They are known for their large investments when it comes to immersive theming. Their parks usually have
			lots of well themed dark rides, and a few coasters. They don’t have the biggest coaster collection, but the ones that they do have tend to be very well made.
			Disney parks aren’t the favorite among coaster enthusiasts because of their small coaster lineups, but they certainly make up for this.
			They have many great qualities. They take you into immersive lands that make you feel like you are on another planet. Their attention to detail
			and charm to their parks makes them loved by many people across the world.

		<h1>Independent Parks</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/ip.jpg">
		<p> The term independent parks refers to parks that are not owned by a chain, meaning that they are the only park in their company. Some of the best independent
			parks include Hersheypark, Knoebels, Indiana Beach, Holiday World, and many others. They typically have a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. Some have old classic rides, and
			Some also have new modern ones. Since it isn't a chain, the company doesn't have any other parks to focus on. This causes them to spend more attention to </p>
